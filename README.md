Contributors: Ruchi Chandrawal, Emily Curlin, Lauren Phelps, Tye Smith, Steve Tuttle, Tyler Williams

Analysis Questions:
Which countries and regions of the world have the happiest people?
Which factors have the most meaningful impact on happiness across all countries/all regions?
Which factors have the least impact on happiness across all countries/all regions?

Summary: 
Factors considered in the analysis included a countryâ€™s measure of: 
Economic stability (GDP per capita)
Family (Social Support)
Health (Life Expectancy)
Freedom
Trust (Government Corruption)
Generosity 
Factors were considered across 169 countries and 16 regions

The analysis starts with looking on a regional scale, first assessing the happiness ranking of various regions of the world, followed a summary of statistics regarding regions happiness ranking. A lower number in the analysis indicates a happier country. The happiest vs least happy countries were then identified and the magnitude of the descrepancy is illustrated. 
The impact of various metrics by region are then evaluated and visually displayed. 
Finally, linear regression analysis is conducted to identify which of the 6 predictors of happiness are most strongly correlated with happiness worldwide.

Tasks Completed:
Tye: Analysis of happiness rank by region, statistical analysis of region by happiness rank, 
Ruchi: Analysis of happiness score by region
Lauren: Analyzing happiness scores of highest and lowest ranking countries by year
Steve: Comparison of countries with highest and lowest happiness score, year-over-year
Emily: Linear regression analysis analyzing correlation between happiness score and various factors influencing happiness.

Findings and conclusions:
The happiest regions of the world from 2015 to 2022 include Australia and New Zealand, North America, while the least happy regions include South Asia, Southern Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. 

The happiest countries in the world from 2015 to 2022 include Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland. 
The least happy countries inlcude Togo, Burundi, and Afghanistan. 
The disparity between the scores of highest and lowest ranking countries is significant; the highest ranked bottom score is more than 200% below the lowest top ranked country.

Linear regresson analysis indicates a country's GDP, a measure of economy, is the MOST strongly correlated with happiness score, followed closely by health.  Overall, genorosity is likely to be predictive of a country's happiness score followed by trust, with consideraton of goverment corruption.
